This is the frontend repository of the project Yolo where customers can leave reviews of Yolo, known as extremely popular Ylioppilastalo student restaurant here in Lappeenranta. Project is build with React + Vite. 

The frontend build is connected to the backend (https://github.com/antti-kuru/yolo_backend) which is created with using Node.js and Express.js. The look of the application is minimalistic as I tried to focus more on the functionality rather than look. This is my first web-development related project and I'm keen to learn more. Next step is to add more testing and some new features.
